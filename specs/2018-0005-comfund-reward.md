## Abstract

Adjustment in reward structure to make a community fund (not a devfee), and still continuing with the principles of Ella of being pure.

## Motivation

An entity flourishes when it is self sustaining. The funds are a basic requirement which is required by every entity in order to become self sustainable. The donations model doesn't work as it used to before and make the entity reliant on third parties which may choose to donate or not donate hence placing obstacles in the improvement and development of the entity.

## Suggestion

Donate some amount from each block reward towards community fund which can be used in development of Ella, pay the developers, use it for listing, make bounties and other marketing stuff. For explaining as an example of how funds can be utilized in development, suppose Ella move towards education sector. The funds can be issued to the content creators depending upon the quality of content that is produced thus ensuring the quality of content is good. 

This won't be under the control of a single entity unlike dev funds of usual coins. It will be controlled by at least 9 and at max 15 members from the community. The members can be chosen/elected through voting/reputation in the community. The utilization of funds will be done only with the consent of at least 51% of these controlling entities thus creating democracy, of the community, for the community, by the community. This can further be done through smart contracts but that would be out of the scope of this improvement proposal.

## Specifications

The current reward structure is 5 Ella/block all paid to miners. The change, if deployed would make 4.5 Ella/block to miners and 0.5 Ella/block. This will produce 1314000 Ella as a community fund in one year. After one year or 2628000 Blocks, these can be reduced to 0.25 Ella/block thus producing 657000 Ella in an year for community fund. This will make Ella self sustainable without compromising the underlying principles.
